            <h2>THE OASIS</h2>
            <p>OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) is a massively multiplayer online virtual reality platform. It was created by James Halliday, a brilliant and eccentric game designer. The OASIS is accessible through special goggles and gloves, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in a digital world that offers limitless possibilities.</p>
            <p>Within OASIS, users can interact, socialize, play, attend school, work, and participate in a wide range of activities. OASIS is not just a gaming platform; it is a complete virtual universe where people spend most of their life hours. It is designed to be a place of escapism and adventure, allowing users to experience their wildest dreams and fantasies. The OASIS contains countless planets, each with unique landscapes, environments, and themes, and is packed with characters, objects, and references from various pop culture sources.</p>
            <p>In the context of the story, the creator of the OASIS, James Halliday, leaves behind a series of challenges and puzzles within the virtual world after his death. The person who successfully solves these challenges and finds the hidden Easter egg is promised ownership of the OASIS and the vast Halliday fortune. This forms the central plot of both the novel and the film, as various characters, including protagonist Wade Watts (Parzival), compete to find the Easter Egg and control the OASIS.</p>

                    <p>This is a Spielberg movie, and even though this story is unique it has many of the movie-making elements he used in such movies as "E.T.", "Raiders", "Jurassic Park", "A.I." and more recently "The BFG". Imaginative cinematography, interesting action, and a really killer of a sound track. That alone makes it a worthwhile viewing.</p>

                    <p>When the trailer came out I was unimpressed and didn't get onboard with the hype at all, yes I was impressed with all the pop culture references and characters but I figured it would be all flash and no substance. Thankfully I couldn't have been anymore wrong, Read Player One has plenty of substance, emotion and charm and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.</p>

                    <p>I've noticed quite a few reviews here from book fans complaining that the movie wasn't true to the novel. As a fan of the book, let me just say that's true but it's fine. The overarching story is the same. The fact of the matter is with a nearly 400 page novel packed full of pop culture references, some things would have to be cut to make it onto the big screen.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>A non stop barrage of 80s nostalgia is what holds the movie together. The characters are your basic prototypes. I'm sure there is a big audience for this but it seemed very long to me and the cutsiness backfired at times. Not terrible but not a that memorable either.</p>

                    <p>Watched 'Ready Player One' as someone who got a lot of pleasure out of the book and who loves a lot of Steven Spielberg's previous work. Despite it getting a fair share of criticism from fans of the book, that there were also enough good things said about it from critics and that many of my friends said it was worthwhile persuaded me enough to see it.</p>

                    <p>Ready Player One is quite possibly the biggest "nerd's nerd film". What I mean by that is that sure the film can be appreciated by the general public, but there's no question that the large part of the population that goes to see it won't be able to truly appreciate the ins and outs of this Easter egg filled movie. Dozens and probably even closer to hundreds of hidden gems fill this Sci-fi feature helmed by one of the all-time greatest directors, Steven Spielberg. If there's ever a film you wish you could pause, zoom-in, and rewind while in the theater, it's Ready Player One.</p>
